# MetacriticRebuild

An attempt to rebuild the website metacritic.com using Angular and Typescript.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.


## Specs
* Metacritic is a website devoted to gathering and displaying ratings for Movies, Games, TV Shows and Music.
* Each entry will have at least a title, a creator, and a single metascore (1-100).
* To start with, all current entries will be displayed to the user on the home screen.
* The user will be given the option of adding an entry via the button on the top nav bar, and will be presented with a form to fill out relevant information.
* When the form is submitted, the form will disappear, the entry will be added to the list and displayed on the page.
* The user will be given the option of editing an entry after it has been created.

## Future Plans
* The user will be given the option of filtering the list by the type of media they wish to see.
* The app will have separate pages for each form of media.
* Each page will automatically filter for that form of media, and display the results.
* The app will allow users to filter each page by metascore.
* The app's splash page will show either random or high-scoring entries, to be decided.
